### Trick Roulette 🛹🎲

This feature was inspired by the infamous [Sk8 Dice.](https://www.longboarderlabs.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/skateboard-dice-next-level.jpg) Expand your bag of tricks and open your third eye 👁️ Here's how to play.

- **1 Player**: There are no rules! Select a difficulty setting that suits you and tap spin for a trick to try. You can try it on flatground, down a gap, off a ramp. Just dont sue me if you go making a fool of yourself trying to jeffwonSong it down a 10 stair.
- **2+ Players**: This is a game of **survival**. **All players** must agree to a **difficulty** setting. **Someone** (It doesnt matter who) **spins** for a trick, Then **all** players must **attempt** that trick. If a player **misses** the trick then they get a letter. S.K.8.M.8 once you have all the letters you are **out**. **Last person** standing is the **winner**. You can **skip** a spin if **ALL** players agree to skip. Last letter gets **two** chances. Its basically a normal game of skate except its all vs CPU. Letter structure can be whatever you want, S.K.8.M.8, S.K.A.T.E, S.K.8, S. Shoot throw the whole alphabet in there if you want to just make sure everyone is on the same page before you start.
